Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I was able to create a simplistic and professional website for my school's student body, in order to 
better adhere to our student body. Furthermore, it includes numerous stylistic components in the website such as, 
the parallax effect, an image slider (transitions between 3 images), the grayscale filter (on the members' images) and various
hover effects. By incorporating Bootstrap, the website can be viewed on devices of all sizes. Website link: https://saranshduggal21.github.io/Turner-Fenton-SAC/
